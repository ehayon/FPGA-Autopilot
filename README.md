##FPGA Autopilot System

Developed by Ethan Hayon

This will ultimately be the home to a multi-copter autopilot system completely developed for field programmable gate arrays

Unlike traditional microcontroller implementations, an FPGA will give us truly jitter-free input/output.

### Testing

This system will be developed on a Digilent Basys2 FPGA. This board contains a Xilinx Spartan 3e XC3S250E with 250K system gates.
